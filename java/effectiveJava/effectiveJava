ITEMS:
1. Consider static factory methods instead of constructors
2. Consider a Builder when facing an object creation with multiple (optional) parameters
3. Enforce the Singleton property with a private constructor or with an ENUM class
4. Enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor

Consider static factory methods instead of constructors.
example: 
public static Boolean valueOf(boolean b) {
        return b ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE;
}

Advantages:
1. They have names: This means that it improves readability. If you have multiple ways of creating an object, it's best if you relate each way of creating it with a different name than just with a set of parameters that should be passed to the constructor.
2. They don't always have to create a new object when they are called: Whenever you call a constructor, you will ALWAYS create a new object. If you use a static factory method, you have the choice of just returning an existing instance - if it is what is being asked - of that object. Imagine you need to create two $5 dollar bills. You don't need to create two different objects for that - if they are value objects - you can return the same instance of that $5 bill to both calls.
3. They can return objects of any subtype of their return type: When you call a constructor, you will return an object of the constructor's type. If you use a factory method and you have a subclass for the class you're creating a method, you can also return objects of that subtype.
4. They reduce the verbosity of creating parameterized type instances. 

Disadvantages:
1. Classes that provide only static factory methods - without constructors - cannot be subclassed. This could be a blessing in disguise, as it encourages programmers to use composition instead of inhearitance.
2. They are not distinguishable from other static methods - so you don't know which ones are the constructors and which ones are not.

In summary, static factory methods and public constructors BOTH have their uses, and it pays to understand their relative merits.
OFTEN, FACTORIES ARE PREFERABLE, so avoid the reflex to provide public constructors WITHOUT FIRS CONSIDERING STATIC FACTORIES.

Consider a builder when faced with many constructor parameters.
Builder - Useful to create objects with various optional characters.
Disadvantages: You have to create a builder to create an object. In performance-critical situations, this could be a problem. It is also more verbose.
Telescoping constructor pattern - Another alternative, where you have multiple constructors. First one with all of the required parameters and then one more for each aditional parameter that is optional.
Disadvantage: Lots of constructors. The more optional fields, the easier it gets out of hand. You still have to fill optional parameters with zeroes.
JavaBeans pattern (setters) - When you have an empty constructor and setters for all parameters. 
Disadvantage: You may have an object in an inconsistent state, you have to write lots of lines of code to set up your object. It also makes the class mutable. =(
In summary: The builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes whose constructors or static factories would have more than a handful of parameters, especially if those parameters are optional.

ENFORCE THE SINGLETON PROPERTY WITH A PRIVATE CONSTRUCTOR OR AN ENUM TYPE

Singleton: A class that is instantiated exactly once.

// Singleton with static factory
public class Elvis {
        private static final Elvis INSTANCE = new Elvis();
        private Elvis() { ... }
        public static Elvis getInstance() { return INSTANCE; }

        public void leaveTheBuilding() { ... }
}

A Single-element enum type is the best way to implement a singleton.
public enum Elvis {
        INSTANCE;

        public void leaveTheBuilding() { ... }
}
This works with serialization, is more concise.

ENFORCE NONINSTANTIABILITY WITH A PRIVATE CONSTRUCTOR
Having non instantiable classes is useful. You can join lots of methods and have an auxiliar class just like java.lang.Math. It's nonsensical to create a constructor for such classes, and if you don't define one, Java will, by default, define that there is a constructor that receives no arguments to build the object. If you make the class abstract, you can still subclass it. It's better to create a private constructor, to make sure that the class will not be able to instantiated.

// Noninstantiable utility class
public class UtilityClass {
        // Suppress default constructor for noninstantiability
        private UtilityClass() {
                throw new AssertionError();
        }
        ... // Remainder omitted
